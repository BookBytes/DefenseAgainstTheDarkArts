<h1>Cyber Security and Policy at Tufts University</h1>

<p>Cyber Security and Policy is a growing interdisciplinary field at Tufts.  Tufts offers a number of courses related to cyber security and policy, and various events are hosted both on and off-campus.</p>

<h2>Courses</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/116">COMP 116: Introduction to Computer Security</a></strong> - This hands-on course for undergraduates and graduate students covers the fundamental topics in security: network analysis and attacking networks, cryptography, web security, vulnerabilities, static and dynamic analysis, and malware.  Topics including privacy, forensics, incident handling, and social engineering are also covered in the classroom course.  This course is offered as a classroom-based course in the fall, and as an online course in the summer.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/150CRY">COMP 150: Cryptography</a></strong> - This course is intended as an introduction to cryptography. The course is intended for senior-level undergraduates and graduate students looking for background material in the foundations of cryptography. The material covered will include various models of encryption - symmetric and asymmetric, pseudorandomness, digital signatures, and network applications to cryptography.</li>
<li><strong>COMP 50 / PS 188: Cyber Security and Cyber Warfare</strong> - This joint Computer Science and Political Science course is an interdisciplinary analysis of cybersecurity and cyberwar in the United States and other countries. It is intended to introduce Computer Science students to the policymaking and intelligence aspects of cybersecurity and political science and international relations students to the technical constraints of computer networks and software. The course will involve hands-on activities such as packet analysis, exploiting a vulnerable system, password cracking, social engineering, reconnaissance, and malware analysis.  This course also will examine state and non-state actors engaged in cyber espionage, counterintelligence, deterrence, and offensive cyber operations.</li>
<li><strong>DHP P249: Foundations of International Cyber Security</strong> - Designed as an introductory course for the generalist, this course will explore the role of power in cyber space; provide a technological overview for the non-technologist; examine the various activities that occur in cyber space, including espionage, subversion, sabotage, and the potential for cyber warfare and the attendant role of the military.  This course will also examine the vulnerability of critical infrastructure and the role of the private sector; discuss law and ethics in cyber conflict; and critique the policies, strategies, and governance structures of key state actors that operate within the cyber domain. Underscoring topics throughout the course will be discussions on the role of risk and how policymakers assess threats and adapt to risk in the cyber domain.</li>
