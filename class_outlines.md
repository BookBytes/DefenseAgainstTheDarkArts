# Tuesday, September 5th: Course Introduction
* This is my favorite course
* Administrative changes:
	- Grace period on all lab due dates
	- No class on the week of Thanksgiving
* A little exercise:
	- When you hear the term "cyber security", list some topics, issues, or things that come to mind. Free-for-all
* What this course is NOT
* What this course IS and expectations
* The schtick is very different in this course, and this may be arguably the most "different" course you will take in the CS curriculum
* Terminology: Is it Computer Security?  Is it Information Security (infosec)?  Is it Cyber Security?
* The definition of security in the context of technology, information, computers
* Why study security?
	- So how far have we come? (or lack thereof)
	- The Tacoma Bridge Failure https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XggxeuFDaDU
* One outcome of this course: question and debate everything
* What's my ultimate goal for you in this course?  We'll revisit this on the last day of class.
* Technology requirement for this class: virtual machine (we will use VirtualBox) and Kali Linux
