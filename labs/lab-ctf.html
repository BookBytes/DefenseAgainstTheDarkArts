<h1>COMP 116: Introduction to Computer Security</h1>
<h2>Lab: Capture The Flags</h2>
<h2>Starting In-Class on Thursday, October 26th in Halligan 102; Write-Up Due Thursday, November 9th</h2>
</div>

<div id="content">
	<h4 class="note">This assignment is worth 30 points.  You must work on this assignment in your assigned team!</h4>

	<h2>Objectives</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Find vulnerabilities in web application(s) and then take advantage of them.</li>
	</ol>

	<h2>Overview</h2>
	<p>In this traditional game, you will be finding and exploiting vulnerabilities in a <span class="stress">series of applications, mainly web,</span> to gain access to information you should not have access to.  The goal is to find the "flags" placed on the server or servers.  As in the past, I will tell you how many flags I have planted.  I will also an provide obscure hint for each of them.  Each team will have either three or four students.  I will allow you to specify who would you like, or not like, to work with.  I will create teams based on your preferences.  Why?  Because team chemistry is important.  Please complete form at <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfhnMPSKg5UIdiSa2Rmd8FpaFi_tN9QNqWYXl9BbMfNqGnl9w/viewform" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfhnMPSKg5UIdiSa2Rmd8FpaFi_tN9QNqWYXl9BbMfNqGnl9w/viewform</a> by Friday, October 20th.</p>
	
	<h2>A Flag</h2>
	<p>In the style of many Security Capture The Flag games, the format of a flag will look like this: <code>key{flag}</code>.  Examples: <code>key{somelongstringthatrepresentshteflag} </code> or <code>key{334359b051f4dda20937055605b3706dfe91d6c8}")</code>.  Each flag will worth a certain value: 100 points, 200 points, and 300 points. Each team will be given a unique key to submit flags.</p>

	<h2>Scoring</h2>
	<p>On the day of the game, there will be a scoreboard that will be displayed via computer projector.  The scoreboard will display a hint for each flag, and the scores for each team in descending order.</p>
	<p>Flags submitted after 6 PM on Thursday, October 26th are worth considerably less than original worth:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Submission of flags by 11:59 PM on Thursday, October 26th: full points.</li>
		<li>Submission of flags between 12:00 AM - 11:59 PM on Friday, October 27th: 50% off of original worth (e.g., a 200 point flag is worth 100 points).</li>
		<li>Submission of flags between 12:00 AM - 3:00 PM on Saturday, October 28th: 75% off of original worth (e.g., a 200 point flag is worth 50 points).</li>
		<li>Submission of flags after 3:00 PM on Saturday, October 28th: No credit.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Instructions</h2>
	<p>A good chunk of this game will be played in-class on Thursday, October 26th Halligan 102.  Additional information, including key to submit flag for each team, will be provided on the day of the game.</p>

	<h2>Assessment</h2>
	<p>There will be two components for grading:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Team's score for the game (15 points).</li>
		<li>Team's CTF writeup (15 points)</li>
	</ol>
	<p>There is no individual component for this assignment.</p>

	<h2>Ground Rules</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Should a team member perform a denial of service (DoS) on the game server, team will be disqualified, will receive 0 points for the team score.</li>
		<li>Should a team member tamper with the scoreboard or flag submission system, 100 points will be deducted from the team's score for each attempt.</li>
	</ol>

	<h2>Preparing to Play</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Get to know your teammates.</li>
		<li>It is important that you tinker with the applications.</li>
		<li>Use your creativity.  That is, if you were an attacker, what would do?</li>
		<li>Be sure to view the source of all the web pages and relevant files.</li>
		<li>This game will be played on a separate segment of the EECS wireless network.</li>
		<li>For some challenges (flags), some programming or scripting may be necessary.</li>
		<li>Resources that would be ideal to have for the game: SQL reference, a proxy (e.g., Burp Suite, TamperData for Firefox), wordlists, Kali or BackTrack Live CD.  You are encouraged to use tools that are on Kali Linux (e.g., John the Ripper).</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>The CTF Write-Up</h2>
	<p>Each team will produce a write-up that submitted electronically in PDF format by Thursday, November 9th.  Designate one team member of the team to submit PDF via private GitHub repository.  Each member of the team shall also have copy of PDF document in private GitHub repository</p>

	<p>So what constitutes a good CTF write-up? For each flag that your team finds, the following information should be provided:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>A screenshot of the flag</li>
		<li>The exact location of the flag (path or file name)</li>
		<li>The exploit or methodology used to find the flag</li>
	</ul>
	<p>A good example of a CTF write-up is <a href="http://blog.ioactive.com/2012/08/stripe-ctf-20-write-up.html" target="_blank">http://blog.ioactive.com/2012/08/stripe-ctf-20-write-up.html</a>.  A list of good CTF write-ups can be found at <a href="http://www.betterhacker.com/2012/02/collection-of-ctf-writeups.html" target="_blank">http://www.betterhacker.com/2012/02/collection-of-ctf-writeups.html</a></p>

	<p>I am lucky to have a collection of some amazing student CTF writeups especially from my Cyber Security and Cyber Warfare class in spring 2017.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/attach/ixnwl84q2gt65/hbzpuemmwrz3b0/j08l66zipq8u/team1.pdf" target="_blank">Example 1</a> - Overall, a fluid report. What really makes this report stand out is the Executive Summary.  An Executive Summary is meant to be read by an executive, who will most likely hard hardly any technical knowledge.  Team 1's Executive Summary has hardly any technical jargon, is concise, conveys a sense of urgency, and connects the problems to well-known past events --which should grab the attention of any competent executive.</li>
		<li><a href="https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/attach/ixnwl84q2gt65/hbzpuemmwrz3b0/j08l6o34wwn8/team5.pdf" target="_blank">Example 2</a> - Started out slowly as Executive Summary was very strong technically (not ideal).  However, this turned out to be a very strong report.  I loved the chart of open ports and services.  Technical details were excellent.  What really make this team's report stand out is the incredible Remediation and Policy Discussion.  Connections with the game to the OPM mess, to the Praetorian report, to RDP brute forcing report by Kapersky, and even to the Mossack Fonseca case --world class.  The Mossack Fonseca case is pretty wild itself.</li>
