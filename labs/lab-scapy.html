<h2>Part 1: GRIZZLY STEPPE (5 points)</h2>

<p>On October 7, 2016, the Department Of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) issued a joint statement on election security compromises (<a href="https://www.dhs.gov/news/2016/10/07/joint-statement-department-homeland-security-and-office-director-national" target="_blank">https://www.dhs.gov/news/2016/10/07/joint-statement-department-homeland-security-and-office-director-national</a>). DHS released a Joint Analysis Report (JAR) attributing those compromises to Russian malicious cyber activity, designated as GRIZZLY STEPPE.</p>

<p>Download the GRIZZLY STEPPE Indicators Comma-Separated Values (CSV) file at <a href="https://www.us-cert.gov/security-publications/GRIZZLY-STEPPE-Russian-Malicious-Cyber-Activity" target="_blank">https://www.us-cert.gov/security-publications/GRIZZLY-STEPPE-Russian-Malicious-Cyber-Activity</a>.  Write a Python program <code>grizzlysteppe.py</code> that:</p>

<ol>
<li>Opens up the CSV file</li>
<li>Parses (extracts) all the IPv4 addresses, replaces all the "[.]" with "."</li>
<li>Outputs all IP addresses on the terminal</li>
<li>Analyze all the IP addresses</li>
</ol>

<p>The big question to answer in your <a href="#readme">README</a>: based on the IP addresses and from your analysis, are you really confident that Russians were behind the election security compromises?</p>

<h2>Part 2: Scavenger Hunt (10 points)</h2>

<p>"Scapy is a Python module created by Philippe Biondi that allows extensive packet manipulation. Scapy allows packet forgery, sniffing, PCAP reading/writing, and real-time interaction with network targets. Scapy can be used interactively from a Python prompt or built into scripts and programs" (from <a href="https://blogs.sans.org/pen-testing/files/2016/04/ScapyCheatSheet_v0.2.pdf" target="_blank">The SANS Institute's Scapy Cheat Sheet)</a>.</p>

<p>Scapy and Python 2.7 are installed on Kali Linux.</p>

<p>Download <a href="secret.pcap">secret.pcap</a> (122 KB).  Write a program using Python and <code>scapy</code> named <code>reconstruct_image.py</code> to reconstruct the image from the packets.  Your program must:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Decode the image from the packets.</li>
	<li>Determine the type of image that is decoded from the packets (e.g., BMP, PNG, JPG, GIF).</li>
	<li>Save the image to file system with proper image file extension.</li>
</ol>
<p>Assume the input PCAP is named <code>secret.pcap</code> and the output image is named <code>output.IMAGE_TYPE_EXTENSION</code>.  You are strongly encouraged to use built-in Python libraries.  Here is a list of all the standard built-in Python libraries: <a href="https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/index.html">https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/index.html</a>.</p>
<p class="note">There is no need to read in the PCAP file as a command line argument (I urge you NOT to do it).  You are not allowed to use any external Python libraries except for <code>scapy</code>.  No credit if you program crashes or if exceptions are not handled properly.</p>

<h2>Part 3: The Incident Alarm (30 points)</h2>
<p>We have covered a number of network scanning techniques, and you practiced finding sensitive information in PCAP files in the previous lab.  This time, you will apply your knowledge to write a tool that provides notification of incidents via a live stream of network packets or via a set of packets in a PCAP file.</p>

<p>Using Python and <code>scapy</code>, write a program named <code>alarm.py</code> that provides user the option to analyze a live stream of network packets or a set of PCAPs for incidents.  Your tool shall be able to analyze for the following incidents:</p>
<ol>
	<li>NULL scan</li>
	<li>FIN scan</li>
	<li>XMAS scan</li>
	<li>Usernames and passwords sent in-the-clear (HTTP, FTP, IMAP, POP)</li>
	<li>Nikto scan</li>
</ol>

<p>If an incident is detected, alert must be displayed in the format:</p>
<p><code>ALERT #{incident_number}: #{incident} is detected from #{source IP address} (#{protocol or port number}) (#{payload or loot})!</code></p>
<p>Example outputs:</p>
<ol>
	<li><code>ALERT #1: XMAS scan is detected from 192.168.1.3 (TCP)!</code></li>
	<li><code>ALERT #2: Username and password sent in-the-clear from 192.168.1.3 (TCP) (AnneOursler:IsAnExpertOnInternetOfThings)!</code></li>
</ol>
<p>Your program does not need to support saving the stream of packets to a PCAP file or saving a record of detected incidents.</p>
<p class="note">You are not allowed to use any external Python libraries except for <code>scapy</code> (except for the extra credit).  No credit if you program crashes or if exceptions are not handled properly.</p>

<h2>Running and Using the Tool</h2>
<p>In Kali Linux and assuming you are <code>root</code>, run: <code>python alarm.py</code>.  By default with no arguments, the tool shall sniff on network interface <code>eth0</code>.  The tool must handle three command line arguments:</p>
<ol>
	<li><code>-i <em>INTERFACE</em></code>: Sniff on a specified network interface</li>
	<li><code>-r <em>PCAPFILE</em></code>: Read in a PCAP file</li>
	<li><code>-h</code>: Display message on how to use tool</li>
</ol>
<p>Example 1: <code>python alarm.py -h</code> shall display something of the like:</p>
<pre>
usage: alarm.py [-h] [-i INTERFACE] [-r PCAPFILE]

A network sniffer that identifies basic vulnerabilities

optional arguments:
  -h, --help    show this help message and exit
  -i INTERFACE  Network interface to sniff on
  -r PCAPFILE   A PCAP file to read
</pre>

<p>Example 2: <code>python alarm.py -r set4.pcap</code> will read the packets from <code>set4.pcap</code> from the <a href="lab-pcaps.html">PCAPs lab</a>.</p>

<p>Example 3: <code>python alarm.py -i en0</code> will sniff packets on a wireless interface <code>en0</code></p>

<p>When sniffing on a live interface, the tool must keep running.  To quit it, press Control-C</p>

<h2>Testing Your Tool</h2>
<p>Your tool must be able to detect the usernames and passwords sent in-the-clear in <code><a href="http://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/116/set1.pcap">set1.pcap</a></code>, <code><a href="http://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/116/set3.pcap">set3.pcap</a></code>, and <code><a href="http://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/116/set4.pcap">set4.pcap</a></code> from the PCAPs lab.</p>

<h2>An Explanation on the Due Date</h2>
<p>Usually, I don't give 4 weeks for an assignment.  Here's why I decided on Thursday, October 19th as the due date:</p>
<ol>
	<li>A number of you will be away for Grace Hopper Conference starting on October 4th.</li>
	<li>Many of you will be going to job interviews during the first 3 weeks of October. This may also mean traveling.</li>
	<li>Tufts Polyhack will be on Friday, October 13th. Making the lab due on that day is not appealing.</li>
	<li>This isn't a trivial lab, especially if this is your first time working with a live network or programmatically reading in packets.</li>
</ol>
